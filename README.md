## About

A website to handle the organization of courses and grades.

#### Current Goal

I want it to be able to store courses and the assignments and their grades for that course. The assignments will be in assignment groups that each have a customizable weight like 5% for all of the combined homework grades and each homework grade could be a percent or like 9/10. The assignment grades will be used to calculate a projected overall grade. The course will have a customizable gpa scale like 97-100 for an A+ and an A+ would be a 4.33 or 90-100 for A and an A would be a 4. The projected final will be used as the courses final grade unless the student inputs a final grade either as a grade, letter grade, or gpa grade. The courses GPA grades will then be used along with the courses hours to calculate quality points then calculate the GPA based on quality points over total hours.

#### Future goals (Don't implement yet)

I would like to make a flowchart function where students can add all the courses they need and each courses requirements in order to see what courses they are able to take and what all courses they would need to take before taking each course. I would also like it to create a visual or pdf eventually.

#### Current

The website currently used Microsoft Auth to handle authentication, my code handles authorization, and a MySQL database controls the state.
Users can currently sign in, create courses, and create assignments but no calculations are made yet and not much is customizable
